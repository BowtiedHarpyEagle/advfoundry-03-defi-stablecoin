 * a 1 token = 1 USD peg. 
 * 
 * The stablecoin has the properties: 
 * -Exogenous Collateral

 * -Algorithmically Stable 
 * It is similar to DAI if DAI had no governence, no fees, and was only backed by WETH and WBTC
 * 
 * @notice This contract is the core of the DSC system. It handles all the logid of mining and redeeming DSC as well as depositing and withdrawing collateral.
 * @notice This contract is VERY loosely based on the MakerDAO DSS (DAI) system.
